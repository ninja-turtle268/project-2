# Diabetes Predictor

<hr>

The ninth edition of the IDF Diabetes Atlas offers projections that continue to put India at the second slot right up to 2045. And the numbers are staggering — just over 134 million Indians will be diabetics in the next 25 years.

India is on the top of the table of a clutch of countries in from southeast Asia — Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Mauritius. Bangladesh, which is second on the list of top five countries with diabetes (20-79 years), however, has only 8.4 million diabetics.

In order to decrease this high diabetes rate in India, I would like to propose my Web Application that functions in such a way that when you enter in your data, thi app can predict how likely you are to get diabetes in the future. This possible web application will eradicate the process of patients finding out that they are diabetic pretty late, enabling them to take care of theirselves from early period itself.
